Welcome to the Blogging Platform API project! This project aims to create a simple RESTful API for a personal blog. With this API, you can perform basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on articles, allowing you to manage your blog content efficiently.

## Overview

This project involves creating an API that handles the following responsibilities:

1. **List Articles**: Return a list of articles, optionally filtered by parameters such as publishing date or tags.
2. **Get Single Article**: Retrieve a single article based on its ID.
3. **Create Article**: Add a new article to be published.
4. **Delete Article**: Remove a single article specified by its ID.
5. **Update Article**: Modify an existing article, identified by its ID.

## Technologies Used

This project utilizes the following skills and technologies:

- **CRUD Operations**: Implementing CRUD operations for managing articles.
- **Server-side RESTful API**: Building a RESTful API to handle HTTP requests.
- **Honcho.js**: Honcho.js will be used as the main backend framework.
- **PostgreSQL**: PostgreSQL will serve as the database management system for storing article data.
- **Prisma**: Prisma will be used as the ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tool to interact with the database.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Set Up Environment**: Install Honcho.js, PostgreSQL, and Prisma, and set up your development environment.
2. **Implement CRUD Operations**: Use Honcho.js to implement the CRUD operations for managing articles.
3. **Database Configuration**: Set up Prisma to connect to your PostgreSQL database.
4. **Test Your API**: Test your API endpoints using tools like Postman or Insomnia to ensure they work as expected.
5. **Documentation**: Document your API endpoints, including their usage and parameters.
